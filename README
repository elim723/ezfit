This is a set of scripts to do oscillation fitting. To learn
how a fitter works in general (doesn't matter you are using 
oscfit / PISA / my fitter), please take a look at:

http://icecube.umd.edu/~elims/Fitter/Basics

To learn how to use ezFit, visit:

More details have to be added, but an overall
frame work is described. Please let me know
everything you think I can improve 
(code-wise, or website-wise)! Thanks :) 

FYI, the name ezFit comes from the names of my very first 
fitting scripts: e_z_histo.py, which builds energy and 
zenith histograms, and e_z_fit.py, which fits the data 
and mc histograms.

 -- misc_tools: fix bug in add_particle_info()

05/05/2016
 -- converter: 
    	-- add in lines to use martin's delta LLH as PID
	   ( user will need to uncomment the lines )
	-- change how RECO info is defined
	   previously: mc flag; pid_attr
	   now: pid is predefined before add_particle_info(); mc if pid=None
 -- misc_tools: 
    	-- add exception to check user's setting
	-- modify add_particle_info() to get flexible PID variable
	-- modify print_events() to not break if backgrounds are not included
 -- masterdict.py:
	-- update default params from http://www.nu-fit.org/?q=node/92#label10

04/29/2016
 -- fix bug in random_sample() in fitter_tools.py
 -- enlarge the minimizer scan range for all norm's
 -- properly dump/load files via with/as statements
