This is a set of scripts to do oscillation fitting. To learn
how a fitter works in general (doesn't matter you are using 
oscfit / PISA / my fitter), please take a look at:

To learn how to use ezFit, visit:

More details 
have to be added, but an overall frame work is described. 
Please let me know everything you think I can improve 
(code-wise, or website-wise)! Thanks :) 

FYI, the name ezFit comes from the names of my very first 
fitting scripts: e_z_histo.py, which builds energy and 
zenith histograms, and e_z_fit.py, which fits the data 
and mc histograms.
